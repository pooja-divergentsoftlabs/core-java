ASSINGMENT-1


•	What is the difference between JDK and JRE?
JDK is java development kit, which is used for developing the java programs and JRE is java runtime environment, which is used for running or executing the 
programs developed in java.


•	What is Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
JVM is java virtual machine provides a run time environment to the java byte code. It is platform dependent and used for converting the byte code into machine
 code and provides a platform to the JRE to run the code. It interprets the code line by line.


•	What are the different types of memory areas allocated by JVM?
Different types of memory areas allocated by JVM are-
            1.Class (method) area
            2.Heap
            3.Stack
            4.PC Register
            5.Native method area


•	What is JIT compiler?
JIT is just in time compilation approach. When JVM converts the byte code into the machine language so converting a portion of byte code into machine language
 and reusing it whenever it is required is done by JIT. It increases the efficiency and saves the time. 


•	How Java platform is different from other platforms?
Java platform is different from other platforms because it is platform independent. It can be run on any OS.


•	Why people say that Java is 'write once and run anywhere' language?
People say so because java is a platform independent language. It can be run on any OS. Here we have to write the code once and can run that code anywhere on
 any operating system. And java supports portability.


•	What are primitive data types?
Primitive datatypes are-
Byte
Short
Int
Long
Float
Double
Boolean


•	Why it is not preferred to use float and double in financial applications, write a program to describe the issue. 
It is not preferred to use float and double in financial applications because using float and double, sometimes it does not give the correct value(gives 
any other or garbage value) so by this the further calculation will be affected and we will not get the correct output. Therefore we have to use Big Decimal 
instead of float and double. 


•	If a variable of primitive data type is not assigned, what does it contain?
If a variable of primitive data type is not assigned, then it will give 0.


•	Why do we suffix L with long, F with Float and D with double?
For floating point literals the default data type is double because of safer arithmetic operations, that’s why we use F with float and D with double to specify
 the datatype that specifically what we want to use.And L with long to specify that the value will be long and will require more space.


•	What happens when you assign a variable of primitive data type to another variable of same type?
It will give error


•	What are reference data types?
Reference datatypes are the non primitive datatypes because the refer to the objects.  They are generated by the programmer and are not defined by java.


•	Write a program and put these below comments in code and explain the behaviour
// \u000A is a newline

// look inside c:\users


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("hello world hii");
        //\"u000A is a newline"
          }}
          
 
•	Print "\u0022+\u0022" through code and explain the behaviour
It will give 68 because \u0022 is the Unicode of “(double inverted comma)
And the ascii value of “ is 34
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char c1,c2;
        c1='\u0022';
        c2='\u0022';


        System.out.println(c1+c2);
        //\"u000A is a newline"



          }}
