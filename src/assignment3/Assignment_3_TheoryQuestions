1.Why String objects are called immutable?
Because if the value is allocated to a string then we can not change that value. If we will change the value then the 
new value will also be allocated but the previous value will not be deleted.


2.How is String object created in memory?
When we will create a object using string literal than it will be stored in the string constant pool, and when we will 
create object using the new keyword then it will be stored in the heap memory and also in String constant pool.


3.What are the advantages and disadvantages of String Immutability?
Because of string immutability it takes a lot of memory ,the data is not deleted at any cost and on the other hand 
immutable strings are cheap to copy, because you don't need to copy all the data just copy a reference or pointer to the data


4.Why String objects are considered thread safe?
String threads are safe because if you will try to change it so it will create the another memory reference so two thread can 
not manipulate the same string reference.


5.What are the advantages of declaring the String class final?
The advantages of declaring the String class final is that it will be more secured and cannot be changed ahead by anyone.


What memory optimization is performed by the Java environment for Strings?
Why you don't have to calculate hash-code of the String object every time it's used?


6.What is String literal?
String literal is the object created by string without using the new keyword and by using the string literal the memory is 
allocated in the string constant pool.


7.What are the differences between String Literal and String Object?
String literal----- String str ="pooja";
String object------String str= new String("pooja");
In string literal, it will create the object in the string constant pool only but in the case of string object using the 
new keyword it will create the object in the string constant pool and as well as in the heap memory.


8.How are the String Literals stored?
String literals are stored in the string constant pool.


9.What is String interning?
String interning means storing only the one copy of the string having the same value .for ex- if pooja is written 10 times 
then using intern we can ensure than only one pooja is allocated in the memory. 


10.How can you intern a String Object?
 When the intern() method is executed then it checks whether the String equals to this String Object is in the pool or not.
